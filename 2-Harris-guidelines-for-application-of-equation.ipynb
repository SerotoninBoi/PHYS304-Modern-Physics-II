An odd function is 0 at the origin, so $\\psi(\\Delta x)$ must be 0. Since the slope is, in general, nonzero, $\\psi(\\Delta x)$ must be nonzero, and we define it to be 1 (affecting only the vertical scale of $\\psi$ overall). An even function, on the other hand, has 0 slope at the origin, so $\\psi(0)$ and $\\psi(\\Delta x)$ must be of equal value, which we can define to be 1.\n","\n","Summary of initial values:\n","\n","Odd function: $\\psi(0) = 0$ and $\\psi(\\Delta x) = 1$.\n","\n","Even function: $\\psi(0) = 1$ and $\\psi(\\Delta x) = 1$."],"metadata":{"id":"MyhTNijQG5Tq"}}]}
