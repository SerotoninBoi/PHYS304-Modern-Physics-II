This rate of change is contained within a differential equation. This differential equation is often not solvable analytically. In this case we use a numerical method to solve it.\n","\n","### First-order differential equations\n","\n","Consider Euler's method, sometimes called Euler's tangent-line method.\n","\n","Given the definition of a derivative,\n","\n","$$ \\frac{df}{dx} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x} $$\n","\n","we can approximate it using finite differences,\n","\n","$$ \\frac{df}{dx} \\approx \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x} .$$\n","\n","Re-arranging we solve for $f(x + \\Delta x)$,\n","\n","$$ f(x + \\Delta x) = f(x) + \\frac{df}{dx} \\Delta x .$$\n","\n","That is to say, if we know the value of the function at any point x, and if we know the value of the derivative at all points, then we can extrapolate the value of the function at a distance $\\Delta x$ from any x. We thus iterate from point to point. We might re-write this,\n","\n","$$ f_i = f_{i-1} + \\frac{df}{dx} \\Delta x .$$\n","\n","In words, the ith value of the function f depends upon the value of the previous value plus some straight-line extrapolated value.\n","\n","## Second order differential equations\n","\n","For second-order differential equations, we need the value of the function f at two points, not just one like in the first-order diff eq. The two points account for the fact that second-order diff eqs have curvature as well as slope.\n","\n","To derive a numerical approach, we write down the finite difference version of the derivative at two points separated by an interval $\\Delta x$.\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\frac{df}{dx} \\approx \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\\\\n","\\frac{df}{dx} \\approx \\frac{f(x) - f(x - \\Delta x)}{\\Delta x}\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","The second derivative is the difference between these two, then divided by $\\Delta x$,\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{f(x + \\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x} - \\frac{f(x) - f(x - \\Delta x)}{\\Delta x}}{\\Delta x}\\\\\n","\\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} \\approx \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x) - 2 f(x) + f(x - \\Delta x)}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","Replacing the function f with Schrodinder's equation yields,\n","\n","$$\n","- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\psi(x + \\Delta x) - 2 \\psi (x) + \\psi(x - \\Delta x)}{(\\Delta x^2)} + U(x) \\psi (x) = E \\psi(x)\n","$$\n","\n","Again re-arranging to isolate the unknown value of function, f,\n","\n","$$\n","\\psi(x + \\Delta x) = 2 \\psi(x) - \\psi(x - \\Delta x) + \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} (\\Delta x)^2 (U(x) - E) \\psi(x)\n","$$\n","\n","This final equation is the one the computer can solve, that is, to iterate to the ith value of $\\psi$.\n","\n","For inputs, we need the value of $\\psi$ at two locations, the mass, the potential function U(x), and our choice of $\\Delta x$.\n","\n","We also need a value of energy, E, to test. We find the value of $\\psi$ at all locations of interest. If the extrapolated function $\\psi$ diverges (does not go to zero at large values of x), then we chose the wrong value for E, and must choose another. We cycle through many values of E until one or more produce a function $\\psi$ that appears to go to zero.\n","\n","Does finding energy E take a long time, or many cycles of iteration? In practice it does not. Fortunately, if the extrapolation of $\\psi$ diverges it does so quickly and obviously, so we can quickly truncate our iterations and discard our chosen value for energy E.\n","\n","If the function $\\psi$ is symmetric then we need not test both positive and negative extrapolations to infinity."],"metadata":{"id":"__IE4uyf4UYl"}}]}
